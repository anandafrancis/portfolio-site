<h1>Testimonials</h1>
  <p>
    Thank you for taking the time to share kind words about our experience together. Everyone I
    have ever worked with has helped me grow not just as a professional but in my performance in
    academia, community service, collaborative environments and my daily life. You have all been
    blessings on this journey and I see these testimonials not just as a
    compliment of the work I've done but a tribute to the influence you've had on me to do such
    great work.
  </p>
