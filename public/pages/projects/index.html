<h1>Tech Projects</h1>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/anandafrancis/tuiter-react-web-app">
  Tuiter React Web App (Ongoing)</a></h3>
<ul>
 <li>Leveraged HTML, Netlify, Bootstrap, CSS and Javascript to create a React web application
 designed like Twitter</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/anandafrancis/brain-image-machine-learning">
  Brain Image Machine Learning (Ongoing)</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Constructed 10,000+ algorithms to explore emotion prediction accuracy and precision based
    on brain parcellation, classifier (Neural Network, Decision Trees, Gaussian Processes, etc.),
    and priming condition of 270 fMRI images from Northeastern’s Affective and Brain Science Lab
  </li>
  <li>Designed web dashboard to visualize confusion matrices, ROI images, parcellation maps, and
    algorithm results></li>
  <li>Leveraged NiLearn, Confusion Matrix, Sklearn, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, KMeans, Random
    Forest, Bayesian, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Passive Aggressive Algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Descent,
    Naive Bayes (Bernoulli, Categorical, Complement, Multinomial), Numpy, Pandas, Scipy (Distance
    Functions) and Gaussian Process to develop algorithms</li>
</ul>


<h3><a href="https://github.com/anandafrancis/job-posting-analysis">Job Board Analysis
  (Apr. 2022)</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Collaborated with 4 classmates to use applicants’ resumes to recommend jobs from Indeed and
    visualize clusters of resumes and job postings to understand skill frequency amongst different
    disciplines and applicants in those disciplines </li>
  <li>Leveraged NLTK, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Requests and Nearest Neighbors libraries</li>
  <li>Applied Principal Component Analysis to reduce data dimensions to improve visualizations and
    job recommendations</li>
  <li>This project was revered so highly that the professor has used it for examples for future
    classes</li>
</ul>


<h3><a href="https://github.com/anandafrancis/crime_data_dashboard">Crime Data Dashboard
  (Mar 2022 - Apr 2022 - Revisiting Soon):</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Constructed interactive dashboard and reusable library showing geospatial models, time series
    animations, sankey diagrams and other charts to visualize and conduct data analysis for crimes
    in Boston from 2015 to present</li>
  <li>Leveraged Plotly, Random, Pandas, Numpy, DateTime, Re, Dash and Sankey to design dashboard
    incorporating data storytelling</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/anandafrancis/nlp-library-bible-analysis">NLP Bible Analysis
  (March 2022- Revisiting Soon):</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Built reusable library to analyze the Bible and create visualizations using NLP tools</li>
  <li>Tools: Pathlib, Collections, Re, Pandas, Plotly, Sankey, TextBlob, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy,
    Requests, Pprint</li>
</ul>


<h3> <a href="https://github.com/anandafrancis/hate-crimes">Hate Crime Analysis (Fall 2020
  - Revisiting Soon):</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Explored different economic, social, cultural, and political factors' correlation
    to reported hate crime rates to better understand what types of environments prevent vs provoke
    hate crimes and how we can better understand the offenders and victims of hate crimes</li>
  <li>Tools: Sklearn, Matplotlib, Pandas</li>
</ul>


<h1>Passion Projects</h1>

  <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rwRddg3CmwnNsAUebaqVUb-Cx0O71FN_3Pfzx8hUVzk/edit?usp=sharing">
    Syllabus Proposal for an Algorithmic Bias, Accountability and Justice course:</a></b> When
  given the opportunity to create a proposal for my ENGW 3302 class, I decided to create a
  syllabus proposal for a class that focused on the interdisciplinary field I'm most passionate
  about: Algorithmic Bias, Accountability and Justice. Attending a university that "is a leader in
  the ethical development, dissemination and use of AI, data analytics, robotics, and information
  technologies to improve people's lives and promote the social good" I believed this aligned well
  with the school's values and has the potential to be a course that could potentially implemented.
