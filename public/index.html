  If you couldn’t tell by the website name my name is Ananda Francis and I am a third
  year Data Science student at Northeastern University. For years I used to get
  frustrated writing and updating my resume. Of course I know to tailor each resume
  to the specific position I am applying to but beyond that, I felt that resumes always
  reflected such a small portion of who I am and the value I bring to a team. I created
  this site to give a comprehensive representation of who I am, what I value and what
  I’ve done. When dealing with clients, employers, and partner organizations it’s
  imperative to have a central hub of information and personality so people can
  really get to know who they will be working with.

  This website includes the following pages:

  I thank you for stopping by and hope you enjoy your stay. This website is still in the works and I am continuing to update daily.
