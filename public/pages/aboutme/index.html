    My name is Ananda Francis. Ananda is defined as "(in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism)
    extreme happiness, one of the highest states of being". Everyone who meets me tells me
    my most prominent feature is my smile and there isn't 10 minutes that go past without me
    letting out a contagious laugh.

    I am also a research junkie; I enjoy reading new research ranging from dataâ€™s influence in
    urban planning to the origin of algorithms and decision making systems. Domain knowledge in
    the social sciences and humanities is my bread-and-butter. Understanding social systems and
    its influence on technology is essential to be successful in data collection, classification
    and analysis; our work must be interdisciplinary and in context to the communities we serve
    if we are to make true efforts in the Computer Revolution.
    <a href="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/">Data Feminism</a> by Catherine D'Ignazio and
    Lauren F. Klein is currently one of my favorite literature regarding the field and has completely
    revolutionized my approach and interests in data science and academia.

    Lauryn Hill is my favorite music artist to date. Her music is transcendental and continues to
    carry me through the most difficult times of my life. Many love her for her album "Miseducation
    of Lauryn Hill": easily top 10 (I'd even argue top 5) in HipHop and in R&B, but my favorite work
    of hers is the live album she recorded: MTV Unplugged 2.0. The raw emotion, spiritual influence,
    interaction with the audience, critiques on current society and the social systems that compose
    it and journey to defining self identity establishes the boundless beauty of the album and the
    resolve and peace that stirs within me any time I listen to it.

    Aside from her music I love reggae and dancehall as an entire genre. Growing up as a Jamaican
    American there wouldn't be a day that goes by where me or one of my family members aren't
    playing Bob Marley, Sizzla, Beres Hammond, Vybz Kartel, JahCure, and all the other great
    musicians of the genre.

    Honestly, I don't really see myself as a person that "likes" anything; if I like it,
    I LOVE it. Within a week of me working my restaurant job and I was telling everyone
    how much I love it there. As soon as I started my major (a field I learned existed a
    month before I came to campus), I was talking about how much I love my discipline,
    mind you I was barely a semester in. I went to Puerto Rico for a week and I spent at
    least a month after talking about how much I loved the atmosphere and culture of the
    island and wanted to move there soon after graduation. I'll watch a bad tv show simply
    because I love the characters and want to see where their story lines take them. I post
    on Instagram everyday because I love laughing and sharing comedy with others. Every
    conversation I bring up some obscure thing I love. I just love... everything. My default
    is just to love things. I bumped into one of my few male friends at Northeastern whom I
    barely even talk to and my first thought after our brief conversation was "Damn I really
    love this guy." If you ask me what I love, no time in the world is enough for me to sit
    and list it all.
